## Introduction

YouTube is a prominent online video sharing and social networking platform owned by Google. This project investigates the characteristics of popular YouTube videos and their impact on personalized services such as advertising and recommender systems.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to leverage historical data from trending YouTube videos to identify comparable trends and apply advanced techniques to predict video popularity. This analysis can help businesses promote their products to the relevant YouTubers and target specific audiences for improved sales.

## Research Questions

1. Besides the correlation between likes, views, dislikes, and comment counts, are there any other independent variables that can accurately predict likes?
2. Can we identify patterns of similar words in video titles?
3. Can we predict the category of a video using its title?
4. Does trending in a greater number of countries result in more views and likes? Does it help videos stay in trend for a longer duration?
5. What is the distribution of video publication by month over different years?
6. Do trending videos from the dataset tend to be published during specific time slots of the day?
7. How long does it typically take for videos to become trending?

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle and contains statistics on daily popular YouTube videos for several months. The dataset includes information on views, likes, dislikes, comments, video titles, categories, publishing time, and more.

## Analysis

The analysis of the data includes various techniques such as linear regression for predicting likes, classification for predicting video categories based on titles, clustering for identifying similar word patterns, and exploratory data analysis to understand trends in views, likes, and publishing time.

## Conclusion

The findings of this analysis provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the popularity of YouTube videos. By leveraging this information, businesses can optimize their marketing strategies and target the right YouTubers and audiences for maximum reach and engagement.
